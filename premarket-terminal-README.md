## What It Does

PreMarket Terminal is a self-hosted financial intelligence dashboard that gives you a professional-grade pre-market overview every morning before the bell. It fetches live (≈15 min delayed) price data from Yahoo Finance, applies rule-based bias scoring, and renders everything in a Bloomberg-inspired dark terminal UI.

**At a glance you get:**
- Current price, % change, and session label (PRE / LIVE / POST / CLOSED) for 120+ tickers
- Directional bias (Bullish / Bearish / Neutral) with High / Medium / Low confidence
- Driver narrative: the dominant catalyst behind each move
- Key levels to watch: support, resistance, and extension targets
- Market-wide risk gauge (0–100 score combining VIX + bear ratio)
- Sector heat map showing which sectors are leading and lagging
- Best Buy spotlight: highest-conviction bullish opportunity of the session
- Sentiment-tagged news feed (🟢 Bull / 🔴 Bear / 🟡 Neutral per headline)
- Portfolio P&L tracker with daily gain/loss, persisted in localStorage
- Interactive portfolio builder with a live donut pie chart
- Scrolling ticker tape across the top (Bloomberg-style)
- Auto-refresh countdown timer (5 / 10 / 15 / 30 min intervals)

### Bias Scoring Logic

```python
def bias(pct):
    if   pct >=  2.5:  return "bullish", "high"
    elif pct >=  0.75: return "bullish", "medium"
    elif pct >=  0.15: return "bullish", "low"
    elif pct <= -2.5:  return "bearish", "high"
    elif pct <= -0.75: return "bearish", "medium"
    elif pct <= -0.15: return "bearish", "low"
    return "neutral", "low"
```

### Market Risk Score

Combines two signals into a 0–100 composite:
- **VIX score** (50% weight): maps VIX 10–50 onto 0–100
- **Bear ratio** (50% weight): % of tracked tickers with bearish bias

Zones: Low (0–20) → Moderate (20–40) → Elevated (40–60) → High (60–80) → Extreme (80–100)

### Price Freshness

Uses `yfinance.Ticker.history(period='1d', interval='1m', prepost=True)` to get the most recent 1-minute candle including pre-market and after-hours sessions — more current than `fast_info.last_price` which only returns the regular-session close.

> ⚠️ Yahoo Finance data is approximately 15 minutes delayed vs real-time broker feeds.

## Limitations & Disclaimer

- **Data delay**: Yahoo Finance data is approximately 15 minutes delayed. This dashboard is not suitable for day-trading or execution decisions.
- **Bias labels are rule-based**: The bullish/bearish/neutral classification is purely algorithmic (% change thresholds). It is not a buy/sell recommendation.
- **News sentiment**: Sentiment tags are keyword-matched, not AI-classified.
- **Not financial advice**: This tool is for informational and educational purposes only. Always do your own due diligence and consult a licensed financial advisor.
